## What Are Harmonics?

Harmonics are special frequency relationships between dimensions that unlock bonuses and reflect the deeper physics of resonance-based dimensional travel. The game detects these relationships every 0.5 seconds and applies bonuses that last for 2 seconds.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Tolerance:** 2% - You don't need perfect precision
- **Detection:** Automatic every 0.5 seconds
- **Duration:** Bonuses last 2 seconds after detection
- **Stacking:** Multiple harmonics can be active simultaneously

---

## Musical Interval Harmonics

Tune two dimensions to create these frequency ratios for bonuses.

### Perfect Octave (2:1 ratio)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 400 Hz, Dim 2 at 800 Hz
- **Effect:** 10% velocity boost in both dimensions
- **Sound:** Dual-tone octave chime
- **Strategy:** Use for fast travel when you need raw speed

### Perfect Fifth (3:2 ratio = 1.5)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 400 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Stability bonus, prevents dissonance buildup
- **Sound:** Harmonious C-G interval
- **Strategy:** Maintain during difficult navigation or near nebulae

### Perfect Fourth (4:3 ratio = 1.333)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 450 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Gradual integrity regeneration
- **Sound:** C-F interval chime
- **Strategy:** Use when damaged to heal over time

### Major Third (5:4 ratio = 1.25)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 480 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Easier tuning (resonance width bonus)
- **Sound:** Bright major third interval
- **Strategy:** Helpful for precise frequency targeting

### Minor Third (6:5 ratio = 1.2)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 500 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Enhanced vibrato depth
- **Sound:** Melancholic minor third
- **Strategy:** Creates richer audio experience

### Major Sixth (5:3 ratio = 1.667)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 360 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Power buildup acceleration
- **Sound:** Warm major sixth interval
- **Strategy:** Use when charging for rift entry

### Minor Sixth (8:5 ratio = 1.6)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 375 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Crystal detection boost
- **Sound:** Gentle minor sixth
- **Strategy:** Use when exploring planets for crystals

### Tritone (sqrt(2):1 ratio = 1.414)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 424 Hz, Dim 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Chaotic velocity perturbation (unpredictable!)
- **Sound:** Dissonant "devil's interval" with low rumble
- **Strategy:** High risk, high reward - use carefully!

### Golden Ratio (PHI = 1.618...)
**Example:** Dim 1 at 400 Hz, Dim 2 at 647.2 Hz
- **Effect:** Enhanced rift detection, crystal bonuses
- **Sound:** Mystical multi-layered chime with PHI overtones
- **Strategy:** The most powerful harmonic - seek this alignment

| **174 Hz** | Foundation | Natural anesthetic, pain relief | Shield boost (1.1x) |
| **285 Hz** | Quantum | Cellular regeneration | Minor heal (+0.5% integrity) |
| **396 Hz** | Liberation | Releases fear and guilt | Stability bonus (1.2x) |
| **417 Hz** | Transmutation | Facilitates change | Rift charge assist (1.15x) |
| **432 Hz** | Natural Harmony | Cosmic frequency, universal tuning | Base heal (1.0x) |
| **528 Hz** | Miracle | DNA repair, love frequency | Major heal (2.0x integrity) |
| **639 Hz** | Connection | Harmonizing relationships | Communication boost (1.3x) |
| **741 Hz** | Awakening | Awakening intuition | Enhanced rift detection (1.4x) |

- Use **Communication** when exploring for landmarks
- Use **Power** when you need to travel quickly
- Use **Regeneration** when tuning is difficult
- Use **Transcendence** for higher dimension work

## Temple Resonance

Ancient temples (like Malta's Hypogeum and Newgrange) resonate at 110 Hz. When any drive frequency is in the 95-120 Hz range, temple resonance activates.

**Effects:**
- Integrity healing: +0.02 per second
- Consciousness boost: 1.5x multiplier
- Announcement: "Temple resonance detected. Ancient healing frequency 110 hertz active."

**How to Activate:**
1. Select any dimension (1-5)
2. Tune the drive frequency to approximately 110 Hz
3. The 95-120 Hz range gives you some flexibility

**Note:** This is separate from visiting the actual Temple structures in the game world.

## Merkaba Activation

The Merkaba is a star tetrahedron "vehicle of light" that activates when you achieve perfect multi-dimensional harmony.

**Activation Requirement:** ALL 5 dimensions must have resonance > 90% simultaneously

**Effects When Active:**
- Shield strength: 50% damage reduction
- Velocity boost: 1.3x multiplier
- Detection range: 2.0x for rifts and crystals

**Announcements:**
- Activation: "Merkaba activated. Light vehicle field engaged. All realms in harmonic alignment."
- Deactivation: "Merkaba field collapsed. Realign frequencies."

**Strategy:**
1. Use the Q key to check target frequencies in each dimension
2. Carefully tune all 5 dimensions to match their targets
3. When all show >90% resonance, Merkaba activates
4. Maintain the alignment to keep the bonuses

## Advanced Techniques

### PHI Cascade
Align multiple dimension pairs at golden ratios for stacked bonuses:
- Dim 1: 400 Hz, Dim 2: 647 Hz (golden ratio)
- Dim 3: 400 Hz, Dim 4: 647 Hz (golden ratio)
- Result: Double golden ratio bonus!

### Harmonic Chord Building
Combine 3+ dimensions in harmonic relationships:
- Dim 1: 400 Hz (root)
- Dim 2: 500 Hz (major third from root)
- Dim 3: 600 Hz (perfect fifth from root)
- Result: Major chord! Multiple bonuses stack.

### Solfeggio + Harmonic Combo
Set two dimensions to Solfeggio frequencies that also form a harmonic:
- Dim 1: 396 Hz (Liberation)
- Dim 2: 528 Hz (Miracle)
- Ratio: 528/396 = 1.333 (Perfect Fourth!)
- Result: Solfeggio bonuses + harmonic bonus!

### Emergency Healing Setup
When critically damaged:
1. Press G until Tuaoi is in Healing mode (432 Hz)
2. Tune Dim 1 to 528 Hz (Miracle frequency)
3. Tune Dim 2 to 110 Hz (Temple resonance)
4. Triple healing effect!
