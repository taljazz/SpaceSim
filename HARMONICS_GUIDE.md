# Harmonic Relationship System Guide

## What Are Harmonics?

Harmonics are special frequency relationships between dimensions that unlock bonuses and reflect the deeper physics of resonance-based dimensional travel.

## How to Discover Harmonics

1. **Tune two or more dimensions** to create specific frequency ratios
2. **Listen for the chime** - Each harmonic type has a unique sound
3. **Receive the bonus** for 2 seconds after detection

## Harmonic Types & Effects

### 🎵 Perfect Octave (2:1 ratio)
**Example:** Dimension 1 at 400 Hz, Dimension 2 at 800 Hz
- **Effect:** 10% velocity boost in both dimensions
- **Sound:** Dual-tone octave chime
- **Strategy:** Use for fast travel when you need raw speed

### 🎵 Perfect Fifth (3:2 ratio = 1.5)
**Example:** Dimension 1 at 400 Hz, Dimension 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Prevents dissonance (stability bonus)
- **Sound:** Harmonious C-G interval
- **Strategy:** Maintain this during difficult navigation

### 🎵 Golden Ratio (PHI = 1.618...)
**Example:** Dimension 1 at 400 Hz, Dimension 2 at 647.2 Hz
- **Effect:** Enhanced rift detection, future crystal bonuses
- **Sound:** Mystical multi-layered chime with PHI overtones
- **Strategy:** The most powerful harmonic - seek this alignment

### 🎵 Perfect Fourth (4:3 ratio = 1.333)
**Example:** Dimension 1 at 450 Hz, Dimension 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Gradual integrity regeneration
- **Sound:** C-F interval
- **Strategy:** Use when damaged to heal over time

### 🎵 Major Third (5:4 ratio = 1.25)
**Example:** Dimension 1 at 480 Hz, Dimension 2 at 600 Hz
- **Effect:** Currently passive, future expansions planned
- **Sound:** Bright major third interval

## Testing the System

### Quick Test 1: Perfect Octave
1. Start the game: `python main.py`
2. Press `1` to select dimension 1
3. Use arrow keys to tune to exactly **400.00 Hz**
4. Press `2` to select dimension 2
5. Tune to exactly **800.00 Hz**
6. Wait ~0.5 seconds
7. **You should hear:** Octave chime + speech "Octave harmonic detected between dimension 1 and dimension 2"
8. **You should feel:** Faster movement in both dimensions

### Quick Test 2: Golden Ratio
1. Tune dimension 1 to **400.00 Hz**
2. Tune dimension 2 to **647.21 Hz** (400 * 1.618)
3. **You should hear:** Beautiful golden chime with PHI overtones
4. **Result:** Enhanced rift detection

### Quick Test 3: Perfect Fifth
1. Tune dimension 1 to **500.00 Hz**
2. Tune dimension 2 to **750.00 Hz** (500 * 1.5)
3. **You should hear:** Fifth interval chime
4. **Result:** Dissonance timer reduced (stability)

## Tips for Discovery

1. **Use Q key** to quickly query target frequencies
2. **Tolerance is 2%** - You don't need perfect precision
3. **Harmonics last 2 seconds** - Reapply for continuous bonuses
4. **Multiple harmonics stack** - Try dim 1-2 octave + dim 3-4 fifth!
5. **Works across any dimension pair** - Not just 1-2

## Mathematical Cheat Sheet

For any base frequency `f`:
- **Octave:** `f * 2.0`
- **Perfect Fifth:** `f * 1.5`
- **Perfect Fourth:** `f * 1.333`
- **Golden Ratio:** `f * 1.618`
- **Major Third:** `f * 1.25`

## Advanced Techniques

### PHI Cascade (Future Enhancement)
