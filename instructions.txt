Golden Spiral Spaceship Simulator Instructions

Controls:
- W/S: Move forward/backward (adjusts r_drive in y-dim for resonance propulsion)
- A/D: Move left/right (adjusts r_drive in x-dim)
- PageUp: Descend (adjusts r_drive in z-dim for -z movement)
- PageDown: Ascent (adjusts r_drive in z-dim for +z movement)
- Left/Right Arrow: Rotate view left/right
- Up/Down Arrow: Increase/Decrease drive frequency in selected dim
- 1-5: Select dimension to tune (1: x, 2: y, 3: z, 4: higher1, 5: higher2); In HUD mode: Navigate items
- J: Toggle between resonance tuning mode (tune all dims) and manual mode (tune only higher dims)
- W/A/S/D: On planet: Move cursor north/west/south/east by 1 unit per press
- R: Read full status (position, velocity, etc.)
- U: Toggle HUD dialog mode (navigable menu); On planet after all crystals: Upgrade menu
- Q: Quick query target freq in selected dim
- V: Toggle verbosity mode (Low/Medium/High)
- M: Toggle starmap mode (navigable menu of nearby bodies/rifts)
- T + =/-: Increase/Decrease HUD text size
- C: Toggle high contrast mode
- L: Initiate landing (near planet, high resonance)
- T: Takeoff from planet
- F: On planet, scan nearest crystal freq
- X: On planet, collect locked crystal
- E: If locked on rift and near with sufficient resonance: Charge/enter rift with guidance. Otherwise: Toggle rift selection mode (if rifts detected)
- Z: In manual mode, toggle speed modes (Approach, Cruise, Quantum)
- =/-: Adjust master volume
- Shift + =/-: Adjust beep volume (planets/rifts/locks)
- Ctrl + =/-: Adjust effect volume (clicks/rotations/chords/hums)
- Alt + =/-: Adjust drive signal volume
- F1: Open this instructions file
- H: Toggle sing-to-tune mode (hum into mic to set drive freq in selected dim)
- Ctrl+S: Save game
- Ctrl+L: Load game
- Ctrl+A: Toggle autosave (every 5 minutes)
- ESC: Quit
- In starmap: Type first letter to jump to items (P for Planet, R for Rift, S for Star, N for Nebula, etc.)

Resonance System:
- Tune r_drive close to f_target per dim for velocity (magnitude by resonance level, direction by sign).
- Power buildup: Sustain >0.8 resonance for boosts.
- Dissonance: Low resonance triggers turbulence jitter.
- Upgrades: Collect crystals on planets for tiered upgrades (width, velocity, etc.).

Viewing System:
- Rotate to mix higher dims into 2D projection—scan for rifts/objects with panned audio.

Rifts:
- Detected nearby with panned hum; rotate to center (pan=0) for entry.
- Lock via selection mode or starmap; guidance provided for approach/alignment.
- Near with high resonance, press E to charge sequence (auto-nudges alignment; sustain resonance to enter).
- Rewards warp boosts or bonuses.

Landing/Exploration:
- Near planet with high resonance, press L to land.
- On planet: Press W/A/S/D to move cursor on grid, scan/tune to crystals, collect with X.
- Sing mode (H): Hum into mic to auto-tune to nearest crystal.
- Upgrade menu via U on planet after collecting all.
- Press T to takeoff.

Starmap:
- Press M to toggle.
- Navigate items with up/down, enter to lock on (autopilot tunes to navigate, lock sound for alignment).
- Items: Nearby planets, rifts with dist/angle.

Accessibility:
- All actions spoken via Tolk.
- Verbosity modes, spatial audio, navigable HUD/starmap.
